#### Kindness, Consideration and Respect.
- Be kind to yourself. You are not less than anyone else because you do not know something.
- Be considerate. Remember that all the coaches and organizers are happily volunteering their time to help you.  
- Respect others. Remember your coach is having patience with you so have patience with your student pair.

**If you have any problems with anyone please let someone know.** [Code of Conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XEnFI3R30IiGXOpC4idb0ku3pw8OoJcBpG9mg3iKiAo/edit)

### A Little Review to Start the Day

**Go over the commandline prompts with your coach so you can be sure you can communicate clearly and easily throught the day.**

#### Coach, your should read these aloud and have the students do them in their terminals
+ See what directory you are currently in `pwd`
+ Navigate to the Desktop directory `cd`
+ Create a new directory called rainbow `mkdir rainbow`
+ Change into the rainbow directory `cd rainbow`
+ Create a new directory in the rainbow directory called leprechaun `mkdir leprechaun`
+ Change into the leprechaun directory `cd leprechaun`
+ Create 3 files gold.md, nyancat.md & unicorn.md (in the terminal) `touch gold.md nyancat.md unicorn.md`
+ List the files in the leprechaun directory `ls`
+ Go into sublime and add a bit of text to the gold.md file `subl .`
+ Open the file in the terminal and read it `cat gold.md`
+ Delete the gold.md file from the leprechaun directory `rm gold.md`
+ Change back into the rainbow directory `cd ../`
+ Delete the rainbow directory `rm -r rainbow`
+ Find the flag to list all the hidden files `man ls` (`ls -a`)

**Hooray for The Terminal Slide Show!**

**Psst** - If you ever see a **`$`** sign in this tutorial, it is not part of the code. The **`$`** sign means that you should type the code that follows it into your terminal.

# Let us Dive into Vue
**In the first section we are going to do a small amount of code but we will learn a lot about it.**

# First of all, What is Vue.js?
## Vue.js is a Frontend Framework. 

#### I. Let's break down what "frontend framework" means. 

“Frontend” means the code that you see in your browser, like Firefox, Chrome, or Safari. 
- A “framework” is like the workbench of tools and supplies that you need to build a project on the web.
- Imagine that instead of coding, you were a carpenter building a house. A carpenter has her workbench of tools. This might include a saw and hammer. But it would probably not include a (cherry-shaped) toilet plunger. The carpenter’s workbench only includes that which is needed for carpentry.
- Our “frontend framework” includes all of the tools we need to create web-pages and only includes those tools.
 
Other Frontend Frameworks that you may have heard of include React, Angular, Ember and many, many more. 
  
We choose to use Vue.js because it is one of the most modern, one of the most   popular, AND the code is **easy to read.** 
  
Vue.js is one of the frameworks you are most likely to use in the real world, and one of the quickest to learn. 


## Let’s get started!

### First, make sure the `vue` command is available in your terminal:
```js
$ npm install -g @vue/cli
```
#### now we can do vue commands, like $ `vue create our-app`

## Let’s create our first app

+ Create to a directory (aka a folder) where you want to create your new Vue app. (You may want to create it on your Desktop so you can easily find it later.)
